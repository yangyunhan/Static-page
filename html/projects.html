                (august 1, 2012-july 31, 2014, funded by nsf)
            </h1>
            <p>Doctoral students comprise a larger portion of the academic workforce,
                yet scholars have very little knowledge of their place in scholarly networks,
                the degree to which they contribute to scholarly output, and the impact of
                this output.Very little quantitative analysis shows the relationship between
                advisors' scholarly practices and the future success of their advisees.This
                study investigates these issues from two main angles:understanding the contribution
                of doctoral students to social-science research (the extent and character of this
                contribution) and the impact of this research (visibility through citations);
                and examining the advisor's knowledge base and knowledge-diffusion practices,
                and whether these factors are involved in expanding knowledge frontiers and how they
                relate to the career trajectories and future success of doctoral students.

                This project will examine topic lifecycles across heterogeneous corpora,
                including not only scholarly and scientific literature,but also social
                networks,blogs and other materials.While the growth of large-scale
                datasets has enabled examination within scientific datasets,there is little
                research that looks across datasets.The team will analyze the importance
                of various scholarly activities for creating,sustaining and propelling new
                knowledge;compare and triangulate the results of topic analysis methods;and
                develop transparent and accessible tools.This work should identify with
                scholarly activities are indicative of emerging areas and identify datasets
                that should no longer be marginalized, but built into understandings and
                measurements of scholarship.

                basic,clinical,and translational researchers including investigators, students,

            <h1>online vocabulary research(ovr)</h1>
            <p>
                One study currently being conducted by the Online Vocabulary Research
                (OVR) project involves a longitudinal case study and analysis of tagging
                patterns in the social bookmarking site Delicious.Previous research has
                indicated that a tagging vocabulary stabilizes over time,suggesing that
                convergence of individual folksonomies occurs as a result participation by
                multiple users in a social tagging application.This study investigates the
                existence of stability and convergence in a subset of the tagging vocabulary
                used in Delicious between 2004 and 2007 and the presence and/or nature of
                community as well as patterns and practices of tagging behaviors in Delicious.
            </p>
            <p>
                A second OVR study addresses the nature of web-based tagging systems.These systems
                have characteristics of structure, design and purpose that have implications for
                the behaviors of users when annotating online resources.Unfortunately,findings
                from studies of popular applications such as Delicious and Flickr have frequenlty
                been extended to all tagging systems without consideration of the heterogeneity
                that exists across systems.This research explores the characteristics of a set of
                randomly selected tagging systems to identify differences and similarities that
                should be taken into consideration when studying the tagging behaviors of users.

            <h1>upper tag ontology(uto)</h1>
            <p>
                Data integration and mediation have become central concerns of information technology
                over the past few decades.With the advent of the Web and the rapid increases in
                the amount of data and the number of Web documents and users,researchers have
                focused on enhancing the interoperability of data through the development of
                metadata schemes.Other researchers have looked to the wealth of metadata generated
                by bookmarking sites ont the Social Web.While several existing ontologies
                capitalize on the semantics of metadata created by tagging activities,the Upper
                Tag Ontology(UTO)emphasizes the structure of tagging activities to facilitate
                modeling of tagging data and the integration of data from different bookmarking
                sites as well as the alignment of tagging ontologies.UTO is described and its
                utility in modeling,harvesting,integrating,searching and analyzing data is
                demonstrated with metadata harvested from three major social tagging systems(
                Delicious,Flickr and YouTube).

                This project aims to use social network analysis to portray the social vocabulary
                evolving in the there major social tagging websites:Delicious,Flickr and YouTube.
                Large set of crawled tagging will be analyzed based on the major social network
                analysis methods.
